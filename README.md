# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The objective of this project is to integrate early users’ feedback to improve the PlanMyTrip app. By including the ability to collect input from users in terms of their weather preferences and the ability to create a travel itinerary between destinations using the Google Maps Directions API, we’ll be greatly improving the experience of the PlanMyTrip users.

## Results
After following the steps, we can map locations that match the weather preferences, as seen in graph 1 and once the destination has been filtered further down, we can map the driving (walking or biking) directions between four destinations to complete a roundtrip, as seen in graph 2 as well as displaying details for each of those destinations including weather conditions as seen in graph 3.
